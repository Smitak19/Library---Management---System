# Library---Management---System
# Project Overview
The Library Management System project aims to design and implement a comprehensive database solution for managing library operations using SQL. This project encompasses the creation and management of essential tables, execution of Analytical SQL Queries, and the application of advanced SQL techniques to facilitate data analysis and reporting.

# Objectives:
# 1. Database Setup: Establish the library_management_system database, including the
creation and population of tables for: • Branches

• Employees

• Members

• Books

• Issued Status

• Return Status

# 2. Analytical SQL Queries: Develop complex queries to extract and analyze data, providing
insights into various aspects of library management.

Report:
• Data Analysis: Generated insights related to:

• Book categories and their popularity

• Employee with most issued of books.

• Book with highest issue.

• Status of issued books

The project has achieved its primary objectives, providing valuable insights into various aspects of library management.

# Key Findings:

# Book Availability: The library currently holds a total of 32 books, indicating a diverse collection
available for members.

# Financial Insights: The total income generated from book rentals amounts to Rupees 221.00,
reflecting the library's financial performance.

# Employee Management: Branch B001 stands out with the highest number of employees, totalling 5,
which may contribute to its operational efficiency.

# Popular Titles: "Where the Wild Things Are" has emerged as the most frequently issued book,
highlighting its popularity among members.

# Average Rental Prices: The project provides a detailed analysis of average rental prices across 10
different book categories, offering insights into pricing strategies.

# Employee Performance: Employee Michelle Ramirez (ID: E106) has issued the highest number of
books, totalling 6, showcasing her active engagement in library operations.

# Book Returns: A review of the last month indicates that no books were returned, which may warrant
further investigation into member compliance and rental policies.

# Outstanding Rentals: A list of members with outstanding rentals has been generated, aiding in
follow-up actions for book returns.

# Branch Performance: Branch B001 has generated a total rental income of Rupees 111.50.
Branch B002 has a lower rental income of Rupees 12, suggesting potential areas for improvement in member engagement or book offerings.

# Longest Rented Book: "The Shining," issued on 25-03-2014, is identified as the longest rented book
that has not yet been returned, indicating a need for policy review regarding overdue rentals.

# Conclusion: 
The Library Management System project effectively showcases the application of SQL in database creation, data manipulation, and analytical querying. The insights derived from the data not only highlight the operational aspects of the library but also provide a foundation for strategic decision making to enhance library services. The project fulfils its aim of creating a robust system for managing library resources, tracking employee performance, and analysing financial outcomes, ultimately contributing to improved library management practices.
